This project, titled “Bank Fraud Analysis: Transactions, Regions & Monthly (January) Trends”, presents an interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Excel.
Using a real-world dataset of 20,000+ bank transactions, the goal is to identify fraud patterns by analyzing:
•	Transaction types and amounts
•	Fraud distribution across states and devices
•	Regional fraud heatmap
•	Time-wise (January) trends
•	Merchant and account insights
The dashboard brings together Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Timelines, and a visually appealing layout to offer meaningful insights. Every section (Q1–Q7) highlights a specific question to explore the dataset in depth, while Q8 acts as a summary navigation panel.
This tool helps detect where, when, and how fraud happens — turning raw data into decisions.
